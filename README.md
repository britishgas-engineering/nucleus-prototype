## Adding a prototype of your own

Open the `/nucleus-prototype` folder in your favourite text editor.

In `/src` you'll find a number of folders with the initials for product teams.

* `/bp` - Billings and payments
* `/btm` - Book track and manage
* `/hs` - Home services
* `/mh` - Moving home
* `/tn` - Team Nucleus

This list will continue to grow as more teams build prototypes.

Take a look in the `/tn` folder, here we provide a few prototype examples.

Open `tn.json`. This is where the defaults for each prototype are set.
