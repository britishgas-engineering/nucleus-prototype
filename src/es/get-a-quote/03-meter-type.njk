        <p>Choose <b>Monthly Direct Debit</b> if you pay automatically each month by Direct Debit.</p>
        <p>You currently pay by <b>Quarterly cash or cheque</b> if you pay by cash, cheque or card when you get your bill.
        Do be aware that <b>you can choose to pay us by Direct Debit</b> which will save you, on average, <b><ns-price pence="4200"></ns-price></b> per year for gas and <b><ns-price pence="4300"></ns-price></b> per year for electricity. Based on an average consumption of 12,000 kWh for gas and 3,100 kWh for single rate electricity, rounded and VAT.</p>
        <p>Choose <b>Pay As You Go</b> if you pre-pay for your energy by topping up your meter. We have other tariffs that may offer better value. To take advantage of them, you’ll need to become a British Gas Pay As You Go customer with your current meter. Then contact us to get a different meter and set up a Direct Debit. If you’re interested – and don’t owe us any money and are happy for us to ask a third party to share your credit rating with us – <a href””>click here</a></p>
