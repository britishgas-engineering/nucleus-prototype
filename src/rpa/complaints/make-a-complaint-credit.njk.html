          <h4 slot="heading">We always aim to resolve complaints as quickly as possible</h4>
          <p>We'll make every effort to resolve your complaint within a day of receiving it. However, sometimes it can take a little longer. If we haven't been able to sort things out within eight weeks, or if we can't agree a way forward with you (known as a 'deadlock'), we'll write and let you know that you have the right to complain the Ombudsman Services: Energy.</p>
          <p>The Ombudsman service is there to help sort out disputes between energy suppliers and their customers. It’s free and they’re totally independent – they don’t take sides and their decisions are based only on the information they have.</p>
          <p>You don’t have to accept their decision, but if you do, we’ll act on what they say. That might mean saying sorry, explaining what’s gone wrong, fixing the problem or paying you compensation.</p>
          <p>You'll find the Ombudsman’s factsheet, which gives you full details of their services and how they can help, by contacting them in the following ways:</p>
          <p>Telephone: <a href="#">0330 440 1624</a> Monday to Friday 9-5pm.<br>
            Textphone: <a href="#">0330 440 1600</a> Monday to Friday 9-5pm.<br>
