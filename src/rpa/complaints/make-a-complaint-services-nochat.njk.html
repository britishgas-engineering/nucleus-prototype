          <h4 slot="heading">How we will try to resolve your complaint</h4>
          <p>As soon as we receive your complaint, we’ll do our best to resolve it quickly. Where we can't, we’ll aim to acknowledge within 48 hours. We’ll also let you know who’s dealing with your complaint should you wish to contact us.</p>
          <p>If your case is complex or involves a number of issues, we may need more time to make sure we’ve covered everything. And if that’s the case, we’ll make sure we keep you up to date – either by telephone or in writing.</p>
          <p>We hope we can agree a way forward that you’ll be happy with. If you’re not satisfied with our final response, or it’s been more than eight weeks since we received your complaint, you may be able to take it to the Alternative Dispute Resolution service (Utilities ADR) or Financial Ombudsman Service.</p>
          <p>They are free, independent services which consider complaints about our range of products, services and financial services matters.</p>

          <p><a href="#">www.utilitiesadr.co.uk</a><br>
            <a href="#">www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk</a><br>
          </p>

          <p>If you purchased a product or service online, you also have the option to visit the <a href="#">European Commission’s online dispute resolution platform</a>, which will help route your query or concern to British Gas and/or the relevant ombudsman.</p>
