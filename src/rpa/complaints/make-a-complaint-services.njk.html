          <h4 slot="heading">How we will try to resolve your complaint</h4>
          <p>As soon as we receive your complaint, we’ll do our best to resolve it quickly. Where we can't, we’ll aim to acknowledge within 48 hours. We’ll also let you know who’s dealing with your complaint should you wish to contact us.</p>
          <p>If your case is complex or involves a number of issues, we may need more time to make sure we’ve covered everything. And if that’s the case, we’ll make sure we keep you up to date – either by telephone or in writing.</p>
          <p>We hope we can agree a way forward that you’ll be happy with. If you’re not satisfied with our final response, or it’s been more than eight weeks since we received your complaint, you may be able to take it to the Alternative Dispute Resolution service (Utilities ADR) or Financial Ombudsman Service.</p>
          <p>They are free, independent services which consider complaints about our range of products, services and financial services matters.</p>

          <p>We’re committed to working hard to provide an excellent customer experience. And that includes dealing with problems or complaints in a fair and efficient way, and with minimal disruption to you. So we welcome any feedback you might have so we can learn from our mistakes and improve our service.</p>
          <p>The following summary shows the number of complaints we received from 1st July 2019 to 31st December 2019. It’s been prepared in line with guidelines from the Financial Conduct Authority.</p>
          <p>During the reporting period we received 100,618 complaints from customers with one or more of our insurance products.</p>
          <p>Putting this into context, our customers currently hold 7.8m insurance policies across our business, which means the complaints received represent 1.3% of the policies in force.</p>
