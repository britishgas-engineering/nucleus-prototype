          <h4 slot="heading">My energy payment card hasn't arrived. What do I do?</h4>

          <p>If your card hasn't arrived in 10 working days and you need to pay for your energy, you can use a debit or credit card to <a href="https://www.britishgas.co.uk/identity/">pay online</a>, or you can <a href="">pay over the phone</a>.</p>

         <ns-expander role="tab">
          <h4 slot="heading">I'm moving house, but I'm staying with British Gas. What will happen to my payment?</h4>

          <p>Let us know about your house move and we'll get things sorted. Here's what will happen.</p>

          <p>1. We'll close your account on the date you move out.</p>

          <p>2. When the big day comes, we'll ask for your final meter reading which we'll use to create your final bill.</p>

          <p>3. We'll then send you a final bill for your old house based on your meter reading. But if we don't have one, we'll estimate it.</p>

          <p>4. But if we already supply your new home, then we might be able to transfer your account for you.</p>

          <p>You can start your home move <a href="https://www.britishgas.co.uk/discover/home-move/#/hub-anonymous">here</a>.</p>

          <p>We're sorry to see you go. If you're leaving us because you're moving house, please let us know. Here's what will happen.</p>

          <p>1. We'll close your account on a date of your choice.</p>

          <p>2. Your new supplier should ask you for your final meter reading, which they'll send to us.</p>

          <p>3. We'll then give you a final bill based on this meter reading. But if we don't get one, we'll estimate it.</p>

          <p>4. If we owe you money, we'll send it to you via cheque.</p>
